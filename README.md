Hii!! This website is a weather app that tells you the weather, wind speed, and humidity of any city in the world. The idea is relatively simple, but I decided to make it because it is highly effective for daily use. 
I also included several aesthetic CSS layout features, which make the website flow and look appealing. This was my first time getting an outside source, in this case it was the API Address, which I then had to link
on my page. I found this to be a little tricky, but it was a fun process to try and figure out! Hope you like it!
